ratethispage-in-ga
==================

A rate-this-page widget which sends all data direct to Google Analytics

It is themed with bootstrap and is basically zero config in the simplest usage:

```html
<div class="ratethispage"></div>
```

Or you can override almost anything with full data attr usage:

```html
<div class="ratethispage" data-prompt="What you reckon?" data-opts="1,2,3" data-category="category" data-action="action"></div>
```
